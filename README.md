# Reveal.js Slide Deck Generator

This project is a simple HTML/JavaScript-based tool for generating [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) slide decks in the browser. It lets you create, edit, and export presentations with minimal setup‚Äîno Node.js or build tools required.
My hope is to create an easy-to-use tool for the creation of reveal.js
slides just using a browser.
I haven't done any sort of coding for a very long time, so this is a
learning experience for me. I'd be very happy to be joined by others!
